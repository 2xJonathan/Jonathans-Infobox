  <h3 class="margin25 yellow">BANGER GAME!! prolly started playing couple months after Global launch, and ive been playing ever since <br> Brawl stars is in my opinion one of the best mobile games and im trying my best not to glaze it too much <br>
  Its such a chaotic 3rd person shooter, you never know whats gonna happen each match making it super replayable <br>
there's like billions of fun gamemodes and stuff to do you'll basically never get bored <br>
And don't get me started on the weekly events, they always be making the game fresh fr</h3>

<h3 class="margin25 silver">Super good "rythm" game tbh but def not the best <br>Honestly i don't really play this no more, since i have been doing so for over 6 years and of course <br> playing the same thing for 6 years will get exhausting <br> the highly anticipated 2.2 update did boost my activity but after a year it got stale again <br> anyways banger game, not for everyone though</h3>

<h3 class="margin25 bronze">I'm not even gonna bother introducing these <br> But before you call me out for being 'childish' and 'immature' <br>
i just want to point out that i only play those when there's a game night with my friends <br> Because my goodness playing with funny people always end up with stupid/unexpected moments i can't lie lol</h3>
