<h3 class="margin25 silver" >Rating: 8.5/10</h3>
<h4 class="margin10 silver">Very Good anime definitely one of the bests out there <br>
if only they didn't screw up the 2nd season of the show it would prob be a 10/10 <br>
Everything about season 1 is just perfect, but s2 is just B.S imo 100% garbage, they skipped so much of the manga its crazy <br>
anyways if you're tryna watch it ONLY watch the first season when you're done finish the rest via the manga</h4>
<h2 class="topnumber bronze">3.</h2>

</div>
<h3 class="margin25 bronze">Rating: 7/10</h3>
<h4 class="margin10 bronze">Controversial take here but this literally would've been an easy 9/10 if it wasn't for the ending <br>
IT WAS STRAIGHT BANGER the show literally is NOT scared to kill its main characters <br>
you literally cannot expect any of the deaths lmao <br>
IT WAS A BANGERR but for the last 3 minutes of the last episode <br> they just HAD to make a love story between Eren and Mikasa (mind you the show teaches you that they're siblings) <br>
Since i'm not the #1 fan of Incest, i just had to put that mf down <br>
anyways, banger anime Def watch it (after made in abyss ofc ofc)</h4>
